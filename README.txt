This is a framework for a Flask web app.
It does not contain much more than what any Python IDE would create when selecting a Flask application.
I created it in order to have my own template to rapidly create flask web applications from my github. However, if you
find it useful please feel free to use it.
In addition to the regular structure created by the IDE new project function, I created and divided the folders
that will contain the JavaScript and CSS files, as well as a folder for common HTML that will appear on every Page
of the web app (usually header and footer). Also, I added a folder for the images used in the project.
Finally, the last folder I created was the models folder where I will store the back-end of the application.
If you are doing a Flask app you should already know this, but I will write just in case:
The folder "templates" will contain the HTML files required for your flask application, and the "app.py" file contains
the launcher of the flask app.
That should explain the structure of the template, happy coding!
